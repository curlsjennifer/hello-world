# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## A to-do list
Use node.js to create a to-do list, we can add or remove item.
1. design two insert bottoms to get elements.<br>

2. if we insert item to "insert" bottom, to-do list will add this item to list.<br>

3. after click bottom, the list length 3 -> 4. <br>

## Follow up
I want to create a website that can search on my leetcode submissions.
1. list all my submissions.
2. sorted by problem id, submission time, difficulty or runtime to get the problems I want to rewrite.
3. make a statistic report about my total submissions.
